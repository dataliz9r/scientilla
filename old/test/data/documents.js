        abstract: "Inspired by recent advances proposed in the ecological psychology community, many developmental robotics studies have started to investigate the modeling and learning of affordances in humanoid robots. In this paper we leverage a probabilistic graphical model in place of the Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) used in a previous experiment, for testing the Bayesian approach towards affordance learning in the iCub robot. We present two experiments related to the learning of the effect consequent from the tapping of objects from several directions and to the pulling of out-of-reach objects by choosing the appropriate tool. The proposed probabilistic graphical model w.r.t the LSSVM not only identifies a regression function for the prediction of the effects of actions but it provides information on the reliability of the predicted values as well."

        title: "Inferior Q waves in apparently healthy subjects: Should we take a deep breath? An electrocardiographic, echocardiographic and cardiac magnetic resonance study",
        abstract: "© 2016 Elsevier Inc. Aim To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of electrocardiographic inferior Q waves persistence during inspiration and echocardiographic segmental wall motion abnormalities for the detection of previously unsuspected silent myocardial infarction, by using cardiac magnetic resonance as the gold standard. Methods We prospectively enrolled 50 apparently healthy subjects with inferior Q waves on routine electrocardiogram and high atherosclerotic risk profile. Patients underwent electrocardiogram during deep inspiration, standard transthoracic echocardiography, and cardiac magnetic resonance. Results Inferior Q waves during deep inspiration persisted in 10 subjects (20%) and cardiac magnetic resonance was positive in 10 (20%). Between the 10 positive cardiac magnetic resonance subjects 8 showed persistence of inferior Q waves, giving a sensitivity of 80% (95%;CI 44.4-97.5%) and a specificity of 95% (95%;CI 83.1-99.4%). Segmental wall motion abnormalities were present overall in 10 subjects (20%), but only in 5 of the 10 positive cardiac magnetic resonance subjects, giving a sensitivity of 87.5% (95% CI 73.2-95.8) and specificity of 50% (95% CI 18.7-81.3). Conclusions Electrocardiographic inferior Q waves persistence during deep inspiration is a simple test with a high accuracy for diagnosis of silent myocardial infarction. Standard echocardiography resulted less accurate.",

        title: "Long-term prognostic role of cerebrovascular disease and peripheral arterial disease across the spectrum of acute coronary syndromes",
        abstract: "© 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. Background: In acute coronary syndromes (ACS), the influence of cerebro-vascular disease (CVD) and/or peripheral artery disease (PAD) on short-midterm outcome has been well established. Data on long-term outcome however, are limited. Our study aimed to explore the effect of CVD and PAD on long-term outcome in a cohort of unselected ACS patients, including ST-elevation (STE-ACS) and non-ST-elevation (NSTE-ACS). Methods and results: The population consisted of 2046 consecutive patients with a confirmed final diagnosis of ACS; 896 (44%) had STE-ACS and 1150 (66%) NSTE-ACS. CVD alone was present in 98 patients (5%), 282 (14%) had PAD alone, and 30 (1.5%) had both. All cause mortality at 5 years was lowest in patients without CVD/PAD (33%), intermediate in patients with either CVD or PAD (62% and 63%, respectively) reaching 80% in those with both CVD and PAD. These findings were confirmed in the STE-ACS and NSTE-ACS subgroups. CVD and PAD remained independent predictors of mortality after multivariable analysis, the combined presence of both carrying the highest risk within each ACS type (HR 4.15, 95% CI 1.83-9.44 for STE-ACS; HR 2.14, 1.29-3.54 for NSTE-ACS). Patients with CVD and/or PAD were less likely to be treated invasively and received less evidence-based treatment at discharge. Conclusions: Across the spectrum of ACS, extracardiac vascular disease harbors a negative long-term prognosis that worsens progressively with the number of affected arterial beds.",

        title: "Impact of high-sensitivity Troponin T on hospital admission, resources utilization, and outcomes",
        abstract: "© The European Society of Cardiology 2014. AIMS: The use of high-sensitivity cardiac Troponin T (hs-cTnT) assay might lead to overdiagnosis and overtreatment of Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS). This study assessed the epidemiological, clinical and prognostic impact of introducing hs-cTnT in the everyday clinical practice of an Emergency Department. METHODS AND RESULTS: We compared all consecutive patients presenting with suspected ACS at the Emergency Department, for whom troponin levels were measured. In particular, we considered 597 patients presenting during March 2010, when standard cardiac Troponin T (cTnT) assay was used, and 629 patients presenting during March 2011, when hs-cTnT test was used. Patients with suspected ACS and troponin levels above the 99th percentile (Upper Reference Limit, URL) significantly increased when using an hs-cTnT assay (17.2% vs. 37.4%, p&lt; 0.001). Accordingly, also the mean GRACE risk score increased (124.2 ± 37.2 vs. 136.7 ± 32.2; p&lt; 0.001). However, the final diagnosis of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) did not change significantly (8.7% vs. 6.8%, p=0.263) by using a rising and/or falling pattern of hs-cTnT (change ≥ 50% or ≥ 20% depending on baseline values). In addition, no significant differences were found between the two study groups with respect to in-hospital (2.7% vs. 1.9%, p=0.366) and 1-year mortality (9.8% vs. 7.6%, p=0.216). CONCLUSIONS: We did not observe overdiagnosis and overtreatment issues in presenters with suspected ACS managed by appropriate changes in hs-cTnT levels, despite the increase in the number of patients presenting with abnormal troponin levels. This occurred without a rise in short-term and mid-term mortality.",
